## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: ICS-first approach -- prove the adapter-to-store-to-view pipeline with the simplest source before tackling auth-heavy protocols
- Roadmap: Custom CalDAV client (~300 lines) over tsdav library to avoid mobile bundling risk
- Roadmap: DingTalk is the primary CalDAV acceptance target, not a secondary concern

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 must validate that Obsidian requestUrl supports PROPFIND/REPORT methods on mobile -- if this fails, CalDAV architecture needs rethinking
- DingTalk CalDAV specifics (auth method, XML deviations) unknown until tested against real endpoint
