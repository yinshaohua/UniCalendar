# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** Users can see all their calendar events from multiple sources in one clean, reliable view inside Obsidian -- especially sources like DingTalk calendar that existing plugins fail to support.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — ics-feeds-and-calendar-views

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (ics-feeds-and-calendar-views) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 4min
- Total execution time: 0.07 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 1 | 4min | 4min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: ICS-first approach -- prove the adapter-to-store-to-view pipeline with the simplest source before tackling auth-heavy protocols
- Roadmap: Custom CalDAV client (~300 lines) over tsdav library to avoid mobile bundling risk
- Roadmap: DingTalk is the primary CalDAV acceptance target, not a secondary concern
- 01-01: Used --legacy-peer-deps for vitest install due to @types/node version conflict
- 01-01: Non-null assertion on SOURCE_COLORS[0] for noUncheckedIndexedAccess compatibility

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 must validate that Obsidian requestUrl supports PROPFIND/REPORT methods on mobile -- if this fails, CalDAV architecture needs rethinking
- DingTalk CalDAV specifics (auth method, XML deviations) unknown until tested against real endpoint
